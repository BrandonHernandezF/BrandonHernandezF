## I am Brandon Hernández, a student majoring in Computer Technology 👋
**Self-taught** 📕💡

While I am working, if I do not understand a concept or a topic, I start to investigate about it by myself on internet (videos, articles, blogs). I really enjoy doing research and catch information.

**Entrepreneurial spirit**  🧐

Investigate and find technological solutions to solve problems. 


**Perseverance** 🌄

If I face a problem, I do not get up early. I try to find the solution as soon as possible, or take my time to resolve the problem. After many attempts, I get success.

**Leadership**  🗣

I am usually selected as a leader for a team. I coordinate my team to achieve easily the objectives and encourage them to give their best.

**Cooperation**  🤝

Colaborate with team partners, sharing points of view and giving the best possible resolution.
